                    I started with Node.JS, then ventured into the MongoDB database, after a few months working with these technologies, I started studying frameworks and HTML and CSS. That&apos;s how I got to know TypeScript and ended up falling even more in love with programming.
                    Today I&apos;m looking for a job in the programming area, I&apos;ve never worked in a company, just as a contributor in organizations or as a freelancer. I&apos;ve done many personal projects, many of them public on GitHub.
